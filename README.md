##PyBank

Given budget data, I wrote a python script to determine the total number of months recorded in the csv file, the total profit, average change in profit, as well at the greatest increases and decreases in profit.

Using a for loop, I iterated through the rows in the csv file, tallying up all the months, adding up all the profits and losses, moving all the differences into a list, and checking all of those differences to determine with is the greatest and least. 





On average the company’s profit decreased by a little over two-thousand dollars, which is probably insignificant relative to the drastic changes occurring month to month, such as those of February 2012 and September 2013. Although those too could be significant or insignificant depending on the company’s production technology and cost structure.


##PyPoll

I wrote a python script to take all of the ballots in an election and, using a for loop, iterate through them to tally up the total ballots cast, the candidates who received votes, how many votes each candidate received, and the winner of the election.
Based on the results, there were 3.5 million votes cast and Khan won with 2,218,231 votes and 63% of the popular vote.
